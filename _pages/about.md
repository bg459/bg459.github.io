## About me

My name is Brandon Guo. I am a freshman at Caltech and expect to graduate in 2024, intending to major in Applied Math and Computer Science.

After Caltech, I want to pursue a PhD in something involving Applied Math or wherever my research leads me. This is constantly changing so I tend to be vague (for example: just two years ago I was sure I would pursue a career in law!).

I created this site during the COVID-19 pandemic (which I hope is finitely long) to log my thoughts and academic progress as I started college. It also serves as a means of expressing myself in a very strange time. I envision myself looking back on this someday and reflect on where I've come since 2020.

In my spare time, I like to play sports, play the piano, or read books. I'll try to keep some running log on these too under "etc." tab.
