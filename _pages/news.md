|December 2020|Participated in AI Hacks, a datathon run by U. of Penn, with friends from school. My role was largely to pursue dimensionality reduction methods to deal with data that was extremely sparse. Our submission is highlighted [here](https://www.notion.so/AI-Hacks-f35c8ee6450e4f24a386897a1bd99f4f).|
|November 2020|Joined Tsao Lab at Caltech, mentored by Erin Koch and Doris Tsao. Working on interpretable AI and generative models as computational approaches to understand 3-D object perception in the brain.|
|October 2020|Built a map-based food delivery app for YHack, Yale University's hackathon, with some friends from school. [Submission](https://devpost.com/software/potluck-bys02q) This was actually inspired by a trend my parents have gotten into: "tuan gou", a type of group buying idea (for groceries, plants, etc.) within a community that has gotten very popular during the pandemic.|
|September 2020|Started school at Caltech (virtually). Time flies, so I created this site as a time capsule of my college experience.|
